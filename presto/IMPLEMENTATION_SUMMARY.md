# TPC-H Benchmarking Implementation - Paul's Feedback Addressed

## Overview

This implementation comprehensively addresses all concerns raised by Paul (@paul-aiyedun) in his pull request feedback. The restructure transforms the monolithic approach into a professional, modular benchmarking infrastructure that aligns with the original plan to decouple benchmark data generation from server deployment and query execution processes.

## âœ… Issues Addressed

### 1. Decoupled Architecture

**Original Issue**: "The plan was to decouple the benchmark data generation process from the server deployment and query execution processes."

**Solution Implemented**:
```
presto/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/          # ðŸŽ¯ Pure deployment (Paul's requirement)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ start_java_presto.sh (focused: only starts services)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/               # ðŸŽ¯ Separated data management
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ generate_tpch_data.sh
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ register_tpch_tables.sh
â””â”€â”€ benchmarks/             # ðŸŽ¯ Independent benchmarking
    â””â”€â”€ tpch/
        â”œâ”€â”€ run_benchmark.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ test_tpch_queries.py
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Each component can be used independently
- âœ… Modular development and testing
- âœ… Easier maintenance and debugging

### 2. Configuration File Architecture Fixed

**Original Issue**: "The correct file to update is either `presto/docker/config/etc_coordinator/config_java.properties` or `presto/docker/config/etc_coordinator/config_native.properties`. Configurations in this file will be ignored."

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Cleaned up `etc_common/config.properties` â†’ Now contains only placeholder comments
- âœ… Cleaned up `etc_common/node.properties` â†’ Now contains only placeholder comments  
- âœ… Active configurations properly placed in coordinator/worker specific files
- âœ… Docker Compose correctly overrides with specific configuration files

**Configuration Structure**:
```
config/
â”œâ”€â”€ etc_common/              # Shared files only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ jvm.config          # âœ… Shared JVM settings (documented)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ log.properties      # âœ… Shared logging
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ catalog/            # âœ… Shared catalog configs
â”œâ”€â”€ etc_coordinator/         # âœ… Coordinator-specific (Paul's requirement)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config_java.properties
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config_native.properties
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node.properties
â””â”€â”€ etc_worker/             # âœ… Worker-specific (Paul's requirement)
    â”œâ”€â”€ config_java.properties
    â”œâ”€â”€ config_native.properties
    â””â”€â”€ node.properties
```

### 3. JVM Configuration Documented

**Original Issue**: "Out of curiosity, what required this setting?" (referring to `-XX:-UseBiasedLocking`)

**Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive documentation in `jvm.config`:
```bash
# Memory Configuration:
# -Xmx16G: Increased from default 4G to handle TPC-H workloads with large datasets
#          TPC-H queries often require significant memory for joins and aggregations
#
# Performance Optimizations:
# -XX:-UseBiasedLocking: Disables biased locking for better performance in 
#                        multi-threaded benchmark scenarios with high contention
# -XX:+UseG1GC: G1 garbage collector for better latency characteristics
# -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M: Optimized region size for large heap
#
# Debugging & Monitoring:
# -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true: Allows JMX tools to attach for monitoring
```

### 4. Script Scope Corrected

**Original Issue**: "The purpose/scope of the start_* scripts is to start up a variant of presto. Benchmark data generation, table setup, and query execution logic can each be captured in their own scripts outside the start_* scripts."

**Solution Implemented**:

**New `deployment/start_java_presto.sh`** (focused scope):
- âœ… **Only** starts Presto services
- âœ… Health checking capability
- âœ… Clear usage documentation
- âœ… No data generation or benchmarking logic

**Separated Data Scripts**:
- âœ… `data/generate_tpch_data.sh` - Pure data generation
- âœ… `data/register_tpch_tables.sh` - Pure table registration

**Separated Benchmarking**:
- âœ… `benchmarks/tpch/run_benchmark.py` - Pure benchmarking logic

### 5. Python Test Suite (Paul's Requirement)

**Original Issue**: "I believe the original plan was to create a python test suite (e.g. using pytest-benchmark) for the benchmarks. This should generally result in code that is easier to maintain long term vs bash."

**Solution Implemented**: Professional Python test suite with pytest-benchmark:

**Features**:
- âœ… `pytest-benchmark` integration for professional performance testing
- âœ… All 22 TPC-H queries with proper parametrization
- âœ… Statistical analysis with warmup and multiple rounds
- âœ… Performance regression testing with thresholds
- âœ… Rich reporting: JSON, CSV, HTML formats
- âœ… Configurable execution: YAML config + command-line overrides
- âœ… Data validation and consistency checking
- âœ… Query categorization (simple, complex, subquery-heavy)
- âœ… Parallel execution support
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Professional benchmark execution
python run_benchmark.py --scale-factor 10 --output-format json --html-report

# Regression testing
python run_benchmark.py --test-groups regression

# Specific query testing
python run_benchmark.py --queries 1 3 6 --benchmark-rounds 5
```

### 6. Removed Unnecessary Scripts

**Original Issue**: "Given that the configurations are already captured in the git repo, I don't think that we need a separate script for generating these configurations."

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Completely removed `generate_config.sh`
- âœ… All configurations are now properly maintained in git
- âœ… No dynamic configuration generation needed

## ðŸš€ Additional Improvements

### Professional Testing Framework
- **Industry Standard**: pytest-benchmark is the gold standard for Python performance testing
- **Statistical Rigor**: Multiple rounds with warmup for accurate measurements
- **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration into continuous integration pipelines
