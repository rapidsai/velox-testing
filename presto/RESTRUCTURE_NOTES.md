# TPC-H Benchmarking Implementation Restructure

This document outlines the changes made to address Paul's feedback on the TPC-H benchmarking PR structure.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Configuration File Architecture ✅

**Problem**: Configurations were placed in `etc_common/` files that get overridden by coordinator/worker specific files.

**Solution**:
- Cleaned up `etc_common/config.properties` and `etc_common/node.properties` to contain only placeholder comments
- Active configurations remain in appropriate coordinator/worker specific files:
  - `etc_coordinator/config_java.properties` 
  - `etc_coordinator/config_native.properties`
  - `etc_coordinator/node.properties`
  - `etc_worker/config_java.properties`
  - `etc_worker/config_native.properties`
  - `etc_worker/node.properties`

### 2. JVM Configuration Documentation ✅

**Problem**: Paul asked about the rationale for JVM settings changes.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive documentation in `etc_common/jvm.config`:
```bash
# Memory Configuration:
# -Xmx16G: Increased from default 4G to handle TPC-H workloads with large datasets
#          TPC-H queries often require significant memory for joins and aggregations
#
# Performance Optimizations:
# -XX:-UseBiasedLocking: Disables biased locking for better performance in 
#                        multi-threaded benchmark scenarios with high contention
```

### 3. Modular Script Architecture ✅

**Problem**: The original `start_java_presto.sh` contained 160 lines mixing deployment, data generation, and benchmarking.

**Solution**: Created separated, focused scripts:

```
presto/
├── scripts/
│   ├── deployment/
│   │   └── start_java_presto.sh       # Only starts Presto services (focused scope)
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── generate_tpch_data.sh      # TPC-H data generation only
│   │   └── register_tpch_tables.sh    # Table registration only
└── benchmarks/
    └── tpch/
        ├── run_benchmark.py           # Python benchmark suite
        ├── test_tpch_queries.py       # pytest test cases
        ├── tpch_queries.py            # Query definitions
        ├── conftest.py                # pytest configuration
        ├── config.yaml                # Benchmark configuration
        └── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
```

### 4. Python Test Suite Implementation ✅

**Problem**: Paul requested a Python test suite using pytest-benchmark instead of bash scripts.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive Python benchmark suite with:

- **pytest-benchmark integration**: Professional performance testing framework
- **Modular design**: Separate modules for queries, configuration, and test execution
- **Configurable execution**: YAML configuration with command-line overrides
- **Multiple test categories**: Individual queries, grouped tests, regression tests
- **Rich reporting**: JSON, CSV, and HTML output formats
- **Parallel execution support**: Optional parallel test execution
- **Data validation**: Automated checks for table consistency and data integrity

### 5. Eliminated Redundant Scripts ✅

**Problem**: `generate_config.sh` was unnecessary since configurations are in git.

**Solution**: Removed `scripts/generate_config.sh` entirely.

## New Workflow

### 1. Start Presto Services
```bash
cd presto/scripts/deployment
./start_java_presto.sh --health-check
```

### 2. Generate TPC-H Data
```bash
cd presto/scripts/data
./generate_tpch_data.sh -s 1  # or -s 10, -s 100
```

### 3. Register Tables
```bash
cd presto/scripts/data
./register_tpch_tables.sh -s 1
```

### 4. Run Benchmarks
```bash
cd presto/benchmarks/tpch

# Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all benchmarks
python run_benchmark.py --scale-factor 1

# Run specific queries
python run_benchmark.py --queries 1 3 6 --scale-factor 1

# Generate reports
python run_benchmark.py --output-format json --html-report
```

## Benefits of New Architecture

### Maintainability
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each script has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular design**: Easy to modify or extend individual components
- **Reduced complexity**: Smaller, focused scripts are easier to understand and debug

### Reliability
- **Robust error handling**: Python provides better exception handling than bash
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive argument and environment validation
- **Retry mechanisms**: Built-in retry logic for database operations

### Usability
- **Better documentation**: Each script has comprehensive help and usage examples
- **Flexible configuration**: YAML config files with command-line overrides
- **Rich output**: Professional benchmark reports and performance metrics

### Testing & CI/CD Integration
- **pytest integration**: Natural fit for continuous integration pipelines
- **Performance regression testing**: Built-in support for performance thresholds
- **Parallel execution**: Option to run tests in parallel for faster execution
- **Multiple output formats**: JSON, CSV, and HTML for different use cases

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Original script locations are preserved for backward compatibility
- Environment variables are still supported where appropriate
- Docker Compose files continue to work with the new structure

### Configuration Management
- All active configurations are now properly placed in coordinator/worker specific files
- JVM settings are documented with clear rationale
- No more configuration generation scripts - everything is in git

### Performance Monitoring
- Python suite provides much richer performance metrics
- Built-in support for performance regression detection
- Professional benchmark reporting with statistical analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Validate the implementation**: Test the new workflow end-to-end
2. **Update CI/CD pipelines**: Integrate the Python test suite into automated testing
3. **Performance baseline establishment**: Run comprehensive benchmarks to establish performance baselines
4. **Documentation updates**: Update README files to reflect the new structure

This restructure addresses all of Paul's concerns while significantly improving the maintainability and professional quality of the TPC-H benchmarking infrastructure.
