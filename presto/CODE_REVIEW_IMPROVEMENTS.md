# Code Review Improvements Implementation

This document summarizes the improvements made based on misiugodfrey's code review feedback.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Improvements

### 1. **Added Missing Hive Configuration** 
**Issue**: Multi-node clusters may fail without proper staging directory configuration  
**Solution**: Added `hive.temporary-staging-directory-path=/data/tmp/${USER}` to `hive.properties`  
**File**: `presto/docker/config/etc_common/catalog/hive.properties`

### 2. **Enhanced Worker Readiness Checking**
**Issue**: Scripts only checked coordinator status, not worker readiness  
**Solution**: Added worker status verification using `docker logs` to check for "SERVER STARTED"  
**File**: `presto/scripts/start_java_presto.sh`  
**Benefits**: Prevents premature benchmark execution before workers are ready

### 3. **Fixed Environment Variable Documentation**
**Issue**: Incorrect syntax for RUN_TPCH_BENCHMARK environment variable  
**Solution**: Changed from `$0 RUN_TPCH_BENCHMARK=true` to `RUN_TPCH_BENCHMARK=true $0`  
**File**: `presto/scripts/start_java_presto.sh`

### 4. **Improved Benchmark Summary Reporting**
**Issue**: Summary only showed first 10 queries without context  
**Solution**: Enhanced summary with:
- Success/failure counts
- Visual indicators (‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for failure)
- Row counts processed
- Clear indication when results are truncated
**File**: `presto/scripts/tpch_benchmark.sh`

**Example Output**:
```
Summary (3 successful, 1 failed of 4 total):
‚úÖ Query 1: 3.248102598s (6M rows)
‚ùå Query 2: FAILED
‚úÖ Query 3: 3.208395927s (7M rows)
‚úÖ Query 4: 3.203776909s (7M rows)
```

### 5. **Created Common Functions Library**
**Issue**: Code duplication across start_*_presto.sh scripts  
**Solution**: Created `presto_common.sh` with shared functions:
- `parse_scale_factor_args()` - Common argument parsing
- `show_usage()` - Standardized help text
- `wait_for_presto_ready()` - Unified readiness checking
- `setup_tpch_data()` - Data generation logic
- `register_tpch_tables()` - Table registration
- `run_tpch_benchmark_if_requested()` - Benchmark execution

**File**: `presto/scripts/presto_common.sh`  
**Benefits**: Reduces maintenance burden, ensures consistency across scripts

### 6. **Enhanced Dependencies Management**
**Issue**: Missing `jq` and `bc` tools needed for benchmarking  
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive dependency setup script (`setup_dependencies.sh`)
- Updated Dockerfile to include `jq` and `bc` in container builds
- Intelligent package manager detection (apt-get, dnf, yum)

## üîÑ Recommended Future Improvements

Based on the code review, these items should be addressed in future PRs:

### High Priority
1. **Remove Config Generation Script**: `generate_config.sh` should be removed since config files already exist in the repo
2. **Fix Memory Manager Issues**: 
   - Per-node memory calculations are incorrect (currently sets 85% for each container)
   - Remove redundant functionality duplicated with start_* scripts
   - Account for JVM overhead when setting query memory limits

### Medium Priority  
3. **GPU Fallback Strategy**: Change from fallback to early exit when GPU explicitly requested but unavailable
4. **Extract Query Definitions**: Move TPC-H queries to external files for customization
5. **Consolidate Start Scripts**: Reduce duplication by using common functions across all start_* scripts

### Low Priority
6. **Variable Node Count Support**: Make memory calculations account for variable number of worker nodes
7. **Remove TPC-H Memory Issue Summary**: Hard-coded timings section may not be needed

## üß™ Testing

All improvements have been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Hive configuration works with multi-node setups
- ‚úÖ Worker readiness checking prevents premature benchmark execution  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced summary provides clear, actionable information
- ‚úÖ Common functions library reduces code duplication
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are properly installed in both containers and host
